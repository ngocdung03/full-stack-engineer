##### Loops
- `do` vs. `while` loops:  In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, while loops are the best choice.
- `do...while`: you want a piece of code to run at least once and then loop based on a specific condition after its initial run. This is where the do...while statement comes in.
- `break` keyword: when we want to stop a loop from continuing to execute even though the original stopping condition we wrote for our loop hasnâ€™t been met
